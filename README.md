## Reg. No. 212224040358

## Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

## Procedure:
1.	Introduction to Prompt Patterns: Begin by understanding the following prompt patterns:
○	Query Decomposition: Breaking down complex queries into smaller, actionable parts.
○	Decision Making: Asking the model to choose between options or directions.
○	Answer Engineering: Refining outputs by giving detailed instructions on how to structure or format the answer.
○	Fact Check List: Ensuring the content is factually accurate, especially for reports or case studies.
○	Tail Generation: Extending the content logically to create depth in storytelling or analysis.
○	Menu Actions: Presenting multiple action choices and guiding the AI to select one.
○	Semantic Filter: Applying filters to control the tone, style, and accuracy of the content.
2.	Choosing the Content Type: Decide on the type of content you want to create. This could be:
○	Reports (e.g., industry analysis, sustainability reports, etc.)
○	Case Studies (e.g., business solutions, technological innovations)
○	Articles (e.g., opinion pieces, educational articles)
○	Creative Content (e.g., comic book story, short stories, video scripts)
3.	For example, you could choose a business report on market trends, a case study on a successful startup, or even a story-based prompt like creating a fictional world for a comic.
4.	Creating the Prompts:
○	Start with simple prompts to generate initial content.
○	Gradually refine the prompts, moving toward more complex techniques like decision-making (asking the model to pick one of several options), tail generation (extending the narrative), and semantic filtering (adjusting style or tone).
5.	Generating and Refining Outputs: Use the model to generate initial drafts, and then refine the outputs using iterative adjustments:
○	For a report, prompt the model with basic data, then ask for a deeper analysis and insights.
○	For creative content, refine the initial story idea with specific details on characters, settings, or actions.
6.	Review and Evaluation: After generating content, evaluate the outputs for:
○	Coherence: Is the generated content logical and structured?
○	Creativity/Originality: Is the content engaging and fresh?
○	Accuracy: Is the content factually accurate (for reports and case studies)?
○	Tone and Style: Does the content match the intended tone (formal, creative, educational)?

13.	Artificial Intelligence Impact on Healthcare
## Instructions:
1.	Select a Topic: Choose a topic (e.g., market trends, climate change, sci-fi story) that interests you.
2.	Use Basic Prompts: Start by crafting simple, general prompts to generate initial content.
3.	Refine Your Prompts: Gradually introduce more complexity by adding details, refining the structure, and using different prompt techniques like decision making or semantic filtering.
4.	Evaluate the Output: Review the generated content for clarity, creativity, and accuracy.
5.	Iterate for Improvement: Based on the feedback, refine the prompts and regenerate the content as needed.

## Deliverables:
1.	First Draft: A basic draft of the report, case study, article, or story generated using simple prompts.
2.	Refined Content: A more detailed and structured output, achieved by applying more advanced prompt techniques.
3.	Multiple Versions: Different versions of the content, showing the effect of prompt changes on the output.
4.	Final Version: The polished version of the content after incorporating feedback and refining the prompts.

That is a highly relevant and advanced objective. Moving beyond simple instructions, employing structured prompting techniques is the key to creating professional, coherent, and complex content like reports and case studies.

The goal is to move from treating the AI as a simple text generator to treating it as an **expert collaborator** or a **project manager**.

Here is a structured plan and demonstration of how different prompting techniques can be used to generate a **Case Study**.

## Demonstration Plan: The AI-Generated Case Study

We will compare three different prompt types targeting the creation of a case study about a fictional company, **"Eco-Grow Farms,"** that implemented a new water conservation technology.

### 1. Simple Prompt: The Baseline

* **Goal:** To show the lack of structure, missing details, and generic tone.
* **Prompt Type:** Zero-Shot (single, vague instruction).
* **Expected Output Flaw:** The report will be generic, miss key sections (like methodology or financial results), and lack a consistent professional tone.

| Prompt Type | Prompt Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Simple** | "Write a case study on Eco-Grow Farms' use of water conservation technology." |

---

### 2. Structured Prompt: The Manager

* **Goal:** To show how defining the **Role, Format, Constraints, and Tone** immediately improves coherence and professionalism.
* **Prompt Type:** Role-Based + Constraint-Based.
* **Expected Output Improvement:** Clear structure (Problem, Solution, Results), appropriate professional tone, and specified metrics.

| Component | Instruction |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Role** | "Act as a **Senior Consultant** from an agricultural technology firm." |
| **Task & Format** | "Draft a **4-section professional case study**." |
| **Content** | "The study must include: **1. Executive Summary, 2. Problem & Solution, 3. Implementation Process, 4. Quantifiable Results**." |
| **Tone** | "**Analytical, data-driven, and confident.**" |
| **Data (Placeholder)** | "The technology reduced water consumption by 35% and cut labor costs by 15%." |
| **Structured Prompt** | "Act as a Senior Consultant from an agricultural technology firm. Draft a professional case study on Eco-Grow Farms' adoption of a smart drip irrigation system. The study must be analytical and confident, containing four sections: Executive Summary, Problem & Solution, Implementation Process (detailing the 3-phase rollout), and Quantifiable Results (highlighting the 35% water reduction and 15% labor cost cut)." |

### 3. Advanced Prompt: Query Decomposition & Decision-Making

* **Goal:** To show how breaking the task down and forcing the AI to make **sequential decisions** results in a highly customized and detailed final product. This is often done through **Prompt Chaining** (i.e., multiple steps).

| Step | Technique | Prompt Instructions | Expected Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Step 1** | **Query Decomposition** | "First, **deconstruct** the following case study goal into **four key research questions**: *To demonstrate the ROI of implementing smart irrigation at Eco-Grow Farms.*" | The AI generates 4 specific questions (e.g., What was the baseline water usage? What is the $ROI$ metric? What technical challenges were overcome?). |
| **Step 2** | **Decision-Making** | "**Analyze** the four research questions above. **Decide** the single most effective narrative hook (Problem Statement) that drives the $ROI$ argument, and **justify** your choice in one sentence. (Options: Climate change pressure, Rising energy costs, Government regulation.)" | The AI selects a hook and explains its narrative advantage, enforcing a critical choice. |
| **Step 3** | **Semantic Filtering & Drafting** | "Now, draft the **'Quantifiable Results'** section of the case study. Ensure the language is **semantically aligned** with the tone of a **financial report** (e.g., use words like 'mitigation,' 'capital expenditure,' 'projected returns'). Include the 35% water and 15% labor savings data." | The AI produces a results section that sounds like it came from a CFO, not a marketer. |

By using this advanced method, you are not just getting text; you are getting **structured output** built upon a series of **expert-level decisions**, demonstrating maximum control over the content's quality, coherence, and underlying structure.

## Conclusion:
By applying various prompting techniques, you can generate high-quality content for a wide range of use cases, from business reports and case studies to creative works like short stories and articles. This experiment demonstrates how structured prompting can guide AI models like ChatGPT to create coherent, accurate, and engaging outputs tailored to specific needs.

## RESULT:
Thus experiment is done successfully.
